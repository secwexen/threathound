# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository or any related system, do not create a public issue. Instead, please report it through our designated security contact channel.

We review all reports, assess their impact, and respond as appropriate. Unauthorized public disclosure of vulnerabilities without prior coordination is strongly discouraged and may violate our policies.
